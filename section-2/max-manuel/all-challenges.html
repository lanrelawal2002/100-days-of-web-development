    <h1>All challenges for the bootcamp.</h1>
    <p>
      The first challenge, as shown on the daily challenge page, will be to
      build a first website. HTML and CSS basics will be explored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second challenge will be to dive deeper into HTML and CSS to explore
      more concepts so as to lay a solid foundation needed for future web
      development tasks or projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give opportunity for review of the concepts learnt up to this point,
      there will be a task that will offer the chance to practice everything
      learnt about HTML and CSS up to this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first challenge involving serving(hosting) a website will follow. A
      simple website will be hosted in this section. In an upcoming section a
      more complex website and web application will be hosted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control with Git and GitHub will be introduced next. A wide range
      of topics will be covered to provide a good understanding of what
      employing version control in projects looks like.
    </p>

      The proceeding text is only meant to be used for following along with Max
