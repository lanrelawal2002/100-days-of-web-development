      Follow your own learning path because it is the only way to simplify your
      journey to becoming the best programmer you can be. Following a path laid
      out by someone else makes the journey unnecessarily difficult. The
      key(magic) is to take whatever resource you have access to and create your
      own learning path. In other words; master the concepts your way in a
      self-paced manner. As you faithfully do this you will gradually realize
      that your unique thinking patterns, thoughts, and your creative spirit
      will come to bare and lead you to your goal far easier than by following
      someone else's path.

      In line with the first point. Don't depend solely on others doing things
      for you. Try your best to do things for yourself. Do all in your power to
      get things done for yourself. When you allow others to do things for you
      or solve problems for you it's their solution and not yours. Consequently
      it becomes harder for you to internalize that solution and make it your
      own. When you think of or come up with a solution to a problem by yourself
      it makes you depend less on others to get problems solved. This way of
      life helps you

      in this world. As a bonus, when you are comfortable solving your own
      problems yourself you easily pick up tips and tricks from how other people
      go about solving thier own problems. This you can incorporate into your
      personal problem solving "arsenal".

      Understanding a problem is extremely important to being able to solve it.
      It is pertinent to state that trying to solve a problem that has not
      really been understood easily leads to frustration and time wasting.
      Before allocating time and resources with the goal of solving a problem or
      meeting a need, it is wise to first of all ensure that the problem or need
      is well understood. It is better to go after a problem that one has a deep
      understanding of than to go after a problem that one is only interested in
      solving. It is important to restress this point. When it comes to choosing
      between solving a problem that a person is interested in (no matter the
      extent of ones interest) as opposed to a problem that one has a deep
      understanding of, the wisest thing to do is to go after the problem that
      is properly understood.
