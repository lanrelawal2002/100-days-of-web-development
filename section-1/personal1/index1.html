  LIFE LESSONS LEARNT WHILE LEARNING TO CODE

  Follow your own learning path because it is the only way to simplify your
  journey to becoming the best programmer you can be. Following a path laid out
  by someone else makes the journey unnecessarily difficult. The key(magic) is 
  to take whatever resource you have access to and create your own learning path.
  In other words; master the concepts your way in a self-paced manner. As you faithfully
  do this you will gradually realize that your unique thinking patterns, thoughts, and
  your creative spirit will lead you to your goal far easier than by following someone
  else's path.
