    <h1>LIFE LESSONS LEARNT WHILE LEARNING TO CODE</h1>
    <p>
      Follow your own learning path because it is the only way to simplify your
      journey to becoming the best programmer you can be. Following a path laid
      out by someone else makes the journey unnecessarily difficult. The
      key(magic) is to take whatever resource you have access to and create your
      own learning path. In other words; master the concepts your way in a
      self-paced manner. As you faithfully do this you will gradually realize
      that your unique thinking patterns, thoughts, and your creative spirit
      will lead you to your goal far easier than by following someone else's
      path.

      In line with the first point. Don't depend solely on others doing things
      for you. Try your best to do things for yourself. Do all in your power to
      get things done for yourself. When you allow others to do things for you
      or solve problems for you it's their solution and not yours. Consequently
      it becomes harder for you to internalize that solution and make it your
      own. When you think of or come up with a solution to a problem by yourself
      it makes you depend less on others to get problems solved. This way of
      life helps you

      in this world. As a bonus, when you are comfortable sovling problems
      yourself you easily pick up tips and tricks from how other people go about
      solving problems.
