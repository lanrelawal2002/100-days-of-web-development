  LIFE LESSONS LEARNT WHILE LEARNING TO CODE
</h1>
<p>
  Follow your own learning path because it is the only way to simplify your
  journey to becoming the best programmer you can be. Following a path laid out
  by someone else makes the journey unnecessarily difficult. The key(magic) is
  to take whatever resource you have access to and create your own learning
  path. In other words; master the concepts your way in a self-paced manner. As
  you faithfully do this you will gradually realize that your unique thinking
  patterns, thoughts, and your creative spirit will lead you to your goal far
  easier than by following someone else's path.

  In line with the first point. Don't depend solely on others doing things for
  you. Try your best to do things for yourself. Do all in your power to get
  things done for yourself. When you allow others to do things for you or solve
  problems for you it's their solution and not yours. Consequently it becomes
  harder for you to internalize that solution and make it your own. When you
  think of or come up with a solution to a problem by yourself it makes you
  depend less on others to get problems solved. This way of life helps you

  in this world. As a bonus, when you are comfortable sovling problems yourself
  you easily pick up tips and tricks from how other people go about solving
  problems.
